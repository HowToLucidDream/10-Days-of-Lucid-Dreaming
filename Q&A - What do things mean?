- Dream Recall -
Dream Recall is what we call remembering your dreams in the morning. Obviously, before you begin Lucid Dreaming, your dream recall wont be the best. Dream Recall is infact needed to 
Lucid Dream as it allows you to remember everything about your dreams. Got bad recall? Not to worry! You can definitely improve it for your Lucid Dreaming experiences with a Dream Journal!

- Dream Journal -
Dream Journalling is the best way to improve your recall. Dream Journals can be physical OR online, whatever you prefer. Dream Journals are what you write your dreams in as well as any 
information you will need to improve. See first section for more info.

- WBTB -
Wake Back to Bed

DesignerJury: "You wake up several times every night. To use those brief natural awakenings for WBTB, you set a strong intention before falling asleep that you will notice when you wake 
up at least one time tonight. Focus on what you want to do and why and then plan to actually do it. Don't focus on repeating random words or anything of the sort, but really on the 
action and goal you want to achieve."

WBTB is when you set the intention to notice when you wake up in the night, then try doing a technique to maximise your chances.
Everybody wakes up multiple times in the night and the point of WBTB is to notice when you do and use it to your advantage.
