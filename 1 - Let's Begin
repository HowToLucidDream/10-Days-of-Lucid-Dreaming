LET'S BEGIN - DREAM JOURNALLING

So, you wanna lucid dream. But where do you start?

The most important thing which almost every beginner misses is Dream Journalling.
Dream Journalling is a very important thing to do as it massively impacts your chances of Lucid Dreaming.

But.. how do you do it?

The first thing you'll need to do is decide where your Dream Journal will be. One option is to simply write it on paper, but make sure it is either in a diary or somewhere you wont lose
the paper as you should also be re-reading the dreams you previously had.
Another option is to do it on the notes app or any other kind of online noting app. Either one is fine.

Now that I know where to put it, what should I put in it?

If you wake up in the night and you are putting details into your journal, make sure to ONLY put SHORT explanations in the journal and make them longer and more detailed when you wake up
in the morning.
The main thing is to always put the most details you can. For example, think of how you felt, what you saw, what you heard, all your senses. If there was anything in the dream that was 
weird compared to real life. Spend MINIMUM 20 minutes everyday on your journal and add anything you remember over the day.

There's a problem. No matter how hard you try, you simply can't remember any dreams no matter what, even while you're journalling. This is where intentions come in. Intentions are set before
you go to sleep and through the day to make sure you remember to remember dreams. This is also used for things like WBTB but we aren't at that stage yet.

Before you go to bed, every night, think to yourself the following: "I will remember to remember my dreams in the morning."
Keep this in your mind while you fall asleep. When you wake up, try your hardest to remember any dreams you had in as much detail as possible. Always make sure to not get frusterated if you
can't remember anything.

What do you write down?
Write down: 
- What time you woke up. (APPROX)
- What time you fell asleep. (APPROX)
- If you can remember, how many times you woke up in the night and when.
- How many dreams.
- Dreams in detail (ALL SENSES)
- See, Taste, Touch, Smell, Hear.

If you cannot remember any dreams, write down:
- What time you woke up. (APPROX)
- What time you fell asleep. (APPROX)
- If you can remember, how many times you woke up in the night and when.
- What you attempted (What intention did you set).
- Add a quote that says something along the lines of: "I cannot remember any dreams tonight, I'll remember tomorrow though!"

It is key to be hopeful and perseverant. Always be positive and don't give up. It takes time
