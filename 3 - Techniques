Firstly, lets start with Wake Initiated Lucid Dreaming, or WILD for short. WILD is where you go straight from being awake to dreaming without losing consciousness, sound crazy? You can do it!
You need to figure out how you fall asleep. 
- A good way is to lay in an uncomfortable position. You wont fall asleep, but you will go through some phases which you will be able to notice, so you can see how they are and how you react
to them. -
After this, it's time to figure out what you're gonna do. As many know, WILD is fully trial and error. You WILL fail during WILD, no matter what. You need to understand that failing is not bad.
It overtime will allow you to change and adapt to your body.

Now, we need an anchor.
If you feel like you will fall asleep easily during WILD, pick a Heavy Anchor.
If you feel like you will find it hard to fall asleep during WILD, pick a Light Anchor.

A heavy anchor could be counting. This will make it harder to fall asleep during WILD.
A light anchor could be mantras, things repeated in your head. This will make it easier to fall asleep during WILD.

The biggest key is to write your experiences after attempting WILD. WILD is trial and error meaning we will need to learn from what we have done. This could be in your dream journal or anything,
just anywhere you can write stuff down.

MILD ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Secondly, lets talk about Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreaming, or MILD for short. MILD involves repeating the intention to realize you're dreaming before you sleep. This helps you become aware 
and control your dreams.
- You will need to set the intention that you will notice when you are dreaming before you go to sleep. You should keep this intention always in your mind for as long as you're doing MILD. -
After this, it's time to put the journal to use. Find a dream that you have the most detail about and read through it. You will need to remember it. Imagine a previous dream you had. Dream 
recall helps you recognize when you're dreaming, which is essential for lucid dreaming. By recalling dreams, you associate your intention to become lucid, increasing the likelihood of recognizing 
you're dreaming later.

If you notice anything weird in the dream that isn't realisitic, focus on that too.

The goal is to teach your brain to realise you are dreaming by seeing unrealistic or weird dream details and by setting the intention. Imagine becoming lucid in your dream, recognizing it's a dream 
due to weird things, and fully becoming lucid.

Finally, repeat it. You should repeat this cycle a recommended times of 3 or 4 before you go to bed. This should take you 15-20 minutes.

Additionally, you can add WBTB to MILD. Do 1-2 cycles before you go back to sleep after waking up from WBTB.
